# Movielense word2vec

The idea of this project is to use word2vec in order to create a recommendation system on the famous movielense dataset. Most of the recommendation systems usually use collaborative filtering. The idea in this project is to treat each user as a sentence and each movie as a word so we can create a vector for each movie. The word2vec algorithm has been implemented in NUMPY
