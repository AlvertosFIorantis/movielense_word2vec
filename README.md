# Movielense word2vec

The idea of this project is to use word2vec in order to create a recomedation system on the famouse movielense dataset. 
Most of the recomedation systems usually use collaborative filtering. The idea in this project is to treat each user as a sentence and each
movie as a word so we can create a vector for each movie. The word2vec algorithm has been implemented in NUMPY
